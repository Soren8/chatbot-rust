# MANDATORY: PROJECT CONTEXT & INSTRUCTIONS

You MUST read `AGENTS.md` before performing any task. This is non-negotiable.

`AGENTS.md` contains:
- Crucial build and run commands (Docker-only).
- Code style and error handling guidelines.
- Mandatory directory structure for logs and caches.
- Testing and refactoring protocols.

Do not proceed without first reading `AGENTS.md`.
